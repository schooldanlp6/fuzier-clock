# fuzier-clock
fuzzy clock that looks nicer than https://github.com/Cj-Malone/Fuzzy-Clock

works with gnome 43 and lower.

maintanance will not be made or required. It just adds a secound fuzier clock to your panel as I liked it more having also the actual time

and installing:
```
#!/bin/bash
git clone https://github.com/schooldanlp6/fuzier-clock/
